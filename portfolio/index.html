            <h3>Reseach Projects</h3>
            <p>Check out my case study of Algorithmic Biases in EDM models. Machine learning is being used in various ways in the educational domain to improve teaching and learning outcomes. One of the most important applications of machine learning in education is in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM). EDM is a multidisciplinary research field that focuses on the development of algorithms and tools for analyzing large datasets of educational data, with the goal of improving learning. g. One of the most used EDM case is to build models to predict student success or retention. However, growth in EDM means growth in algorithmic bias, and it is imperative that we work to understand the bias that data mining models/algorithms may result in.</p>

            <h3>Seahawk Assitance- Honors Thesis</h3>
            <p>I cannot explain how special and exciting this project is to me. My Honors Thesis project is to create a ChatGPT model tailored specifically
                for the University of North Carolina Wilmington. This chatbot can answer questions regarding information specifically from the UNCW knoweledge base,UNCW webiste,Rate my professor, and Wilmington city reviews.
                While the project is in progress and not yet complete, I am excited to announce that it is scheduled for publication this fall. 
                Stay tuned for its release, and thank you for your interest and support!</p>
