            <h1>April Villeda Roblero</h1>
            <p> I'm a dedicated computer science student focused on AI and software engineering, located in Wilmington, NC.
            With a deep passion for tech, I've committed myself to exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence and developing skills that can contribute to meaningful innovations.
            </p>

            <p> As a first-generation college student, the journey through higher education has been both challenging and rewarding. It's taught me the value of resilience, hard work, and the importance of paving the way for others who come from similar backgrounds.
             My ambition is not only to succeed in my field but also to inspire and uplift those who see their dreams as out of reach.</p>

             <p> When I'm not coding or studying, I love to explore the different cultures and food of the world. Traveling not only broadens my horizons but also fuels my creativity, providing fresh perspectives that I bring back to my work.
             I'm excited about the future and eager to continue on this path of higher education, innovation, and advocay.</p>
