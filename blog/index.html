                <p>As part of the honors college at UNCW, I went on a short-term study abroad program. I had a full semester of classes that were focused on the culture, history, and language of Peru. I visited many historical sites and learned about the Inca civilization. My classmates and I hiked the famous Inca Trail that leads to Machu Picchu. I will say that this trail was very challenging, but the view was breathtaking. On one of the nights, we could see the Milky Way. It was absolutely incredible. We also visited many museums, and it was fascinating to see the horticultural aspects that we had studied all semester. Peru has amazing food - it is SO good! I looked forward to every meal. If you ever find yourself in Peru, I recommend you try pisco sours, specifically the maracuya (passionfruit) flavor.
                    Aguas Calientes gets a bad rep, sometimes called the "Myrtle Beach" of South Carolina. I honestly really enjoyed it, and my friends and I had an amazing time exploring the nightlife.
                    If you go to Peru, without a doubt, you will see some llamas. They are so beautiful - stay on the lookout for people who offer you to take a picture with decorated llamas (sometimes they are dressed-up goats).
                    If you are feeling adventurous, I recommend you try the famous dish - cuy. Cuy is roasted guinea pig. I know how that may sound, but it's actually pretty good.
                    If you get the chance, I recommend you visit local animal rehabilitation centers. Usually, there are condors - Peru's national bird. They are beautiful, and seeing them in action is breathtaking.
                    Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, and Aguas Calientes are amazing! The people there are very friendly and trustworthy. This is one of my favorite places I have ever been. It is crazy to know that the Inca civilization was so advanced in technology. After the Spanish conquest, much of the original architecture was destroyed, but some ruins still remain.
                    I strongly recommend you visit Peru - I promise the food is literally so delicious you won't be disappointed.</p>

        <h2>France</h2>

                <p>My trip to Paris was pretty short- it was a 2 day trip. So my iternarary was pretty compact because I wanted to do a lot of things. 
                My boyfriend came to visit me abroad so we did try to make this trip to France a bit more romantic. 

                France is beatiful. I was able to see the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre Dame. I also got to see the Mona Lisa. 
                I had a croissant every morning and I had a crepe every night. I don't know a lot of French but I knew excatly how to say " a chocolate croissant please" ("pain au chocolat 
                s'il te plaît"). Even though I am not fluent in French, I was able to get around pretty easily with Spanish.
                
                My boyfriend actually found a small chicken place that was amazing. It was really good and it tasted excatly like chick-fil- a!! I don't remember the exact name but I think its called big farmer. It has a green logo with a chicken. 

                On another note, the weather was terrible. It was freezing cold! I was not prepared for the cold weather. I had to buy a scarf and gloves. I was not expecting it to be that cold. 
                I was not able to wear a lot of the outfits that I had planned because it was so cold. I was able to wear my beret though. I was so happy about that.

                Transportation very difficult for us to understand at first but we were able to get the hang of it. We were able to take the metro everywhere. 
                However, we did get lost a few times. We asked for directions many times to get back on track. Especially becasue I did not realize how far our airbnb was from the city center. I have it listed in the 
                itenrary but I recommend you stay closer to the city center.
    
                Unfortunately, on our last day we had to wake up pretty early to catch our flight. And of course, we had to take the metro to the airport - until we found out it was CLOSED. 
                Somehow a cafe owner called us a taxi and we were able to make it to the airport on time. It was a crazy experience and the cafe owner was extremly helpful (we were communicating through google translate...insert crying emoji).

                Some highlights of my trip included the boat tour. It was FREEZING, but it was so beautiful and magical. I also visited Carette Café, which I had heard about on TikTok. I had to go because it looked so aesthetic. It was so cute, and the hot chocolate was amazing.
                I also went to the Love Lock Bridge. I was so excited to go there since I had seen it in movies and had always wanted to visit. I was able to put a lock on the bridge with my boyfriend, which was so romantic.
                Another favorite moment in France was when my boyfriend gave me a promise ring under the sparkling Eiffel Tower. It was so sweet, and I was so happy. I will never forget that trip.
                And, of course, I can't forget about the shopping. I was able to go to the Champs-Élysées and Galeries Lafayette. I bought some clothes and a lot of souvenirs.
                I recommend you visit Paris at least once in your life. It is so beautiful, and there is so much to do. I promise you will not be disappointed.</p>

        <h2>Mexico</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p class="post-excerpt">My trip to Mexico has been a long time coming...</p>
            <button class="read-more-btn">Read Full Post</button>
            <div class="full-post hidden">
                <p> My dad is from Mexico City (CDMX), specifically in Coyoacán. I have always wanted to visit my family in Mexico since none of them are here in the US. I was supposed to go to Mexico in 2020, but due to the pandemic, I was not able to go. I was so sad because my grandpa had passed away two years before and my grandma was not doing well. 
                    Unfortunately, my grandma passed away during the pandemic, and I was not able to go to her funeral. If there is one thing I wish, it is to have met my grandparents. I have heard so many stories about them, and I have seen so many pictures. I wish I could have met them. But my aunt tells me that even though I did not meet them, they are always watching over me.
                    I was finally able to go to Mexico in 2023. I was so excited to see my family. I was able to see my cousins, aunts, and uncles. It was so emotional for me. I was able to see my grandma's house, and I was able to see the house where my dad grew up. It was so beautiful, and I was so happy to be there.
                    At first, I was hesitant because everyone kept telling me it was dangerous. But let me tell you... it was so much fun! I personally did not feel unsafe in Mexico City—I am not saying that it is not dangerous, but it was not my experience.
                    Also, I think it's INSANE how I thought CDMX was going to be a small city. It is HUGE—larger than Los Angeles and New York. I was so surprised by how big it was. And also how NICE it is. The malls were actually insane. Think about the nicest malls you have ever been to and then multiply that by 10. 
                    Honestly, all of Mexico City is so cute and nice. The architecture, design, color, music, and the people. Everything is just so vibrant and alive. I wish the United States had more aspects of the way of life in Mexico. I feel like the United States is very industrial and the buildings are so bland. 
                    Mexico is so warm and welcoming, and there's so much greenery.
                    
                    I stayed in Mexico for a week, so I was able to go to a lot of places. Feel free to download the itinerary for ideas, but it does not have much structure because I was staying with my aunt and uncle, and they were showing me around.
                    While I was in Mexico, I visited the Frida Kahlo Museum (it was close to my grandparents' home). I was staying in Coyoacán, so at least half of my time in Mexico I was exploring Coyoacán. Honestly, that was my favorite place in Mexico City. 
                    There are so many markets, and let me tell you, if you want to try some bomb ice cream, GO to Coyoacán. It is absolutely amazing. I love ice cream, but if there is one thing I love more than ice cream, it is Mexican hot chocolate and churros. 
                    My aunt took me to El Moro. Girl—it was SO good. If I could take a flight to Mexico City just to get some churros, I would. I wanted to go there every day—I was obsessed. It was so magical. I never wanted to leave El Moro. I truly cannot wait to go back.
                    
                    If you are a foodie, you will love Mexico. Street tacos? Sign me up. Food markets? Trust me, I will be there. I am a Mexican corn fanatic—I love elote and esquites so much that I grew up with a nickname (I can't share...too embarrassing) because of it. 
                    The amount of corn I ate in Mexico was insane. I honestly probably gained a couple of pounds because I could not stop eating. I also had some crepes, and they were so delicious. And the tacos...ni se diga. I ate so many tacos that I lost count. 
                    I recommend everyone go to Mexico City just for the food. It is so delicious.
                    Outside of eating, I did actually do other things that did not involve chewing. For example, I went on a small excursion to the pyramids. I was so excited to see them in person.
                    I also got to see a bird's eye view of the city when my aunt and uncle took me to the Torre Latinoamericana. And of course, I had to visit the iconic Angel de la Independencia. I also went to the Zócalo, and I was able to see the Palacio de Bellas Artes—insane. 
                    The culture is phenomenal. I am not Catholic, but I visited multiple cathedrals, and they were so beautiful. When I was in Peru and France, I saw many cathedrals, but the ones in Mexico were so different. They were so colorful and vibrant.
                
                    I loved absolutely everything about Mexico. I was just so happy to be there and get to know my culture and where my roots are from. I want to go back to Mexico very soon. I have an internship this summer, but hopefully, next year I can go back. There is so much more to explore and so much more to learn. </p>
